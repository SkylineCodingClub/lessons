# Recap

1. Variables
2. Functions

---

# Variables

Last time we got to talk about two different variables types

## integers

example:

```python
    radius = 1
    pi = 3.1415926535
    print pi * r ** 2
```
output: 

    9.86960437853

```

## strings

example:
```python
    greeting = "Hello World!"
    print greeting
```
```
    Hello World!
```

# Functions

Last time we also talked about some "built-in" functions

---

# Functions

Last time we also talked about some "built-in" functions
## raw\_input()

example:
```python
    print "What is your name? "
    name = raw_input()
    print "Hello ", name
```
```
    What is your name?
    &gt; Mark
    Hello Mark
```

```python
    print "What is your name? "
    name = raw_input()
    print "Hello ", name
```
```
    What is your name?
    &gt; Mark
    Hello Mark
```

## math.sqrt(number)

example:
```python
    import math
    print "Say something irrational"
    print math.sqrt(2)
```
```
    Say something irrational
    1.41421356237
```

---

# User Defined Functions

Finally we talked about defining your own function

---

# User Defined Functions

Finally we talked about defining your own function
```python
import math
def pythag(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2)
```

---

# User Defined Functions

Finally we talked about defining your own function
```python
import math
def pythag(a, b):
    return math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2)
```
Here we define a function called `pythag` with "arguments" `a` and `b`

```python
    import math
    def pythag(a, b):
        return math.sqrt(a ** 2 + b ** 2)
```
Here we define a function called `pythag` with "arguments" `a` and `b`

Remember that the `return` keyword specifies the value that the function 
evaluates to

# This Time
- String Manipulation
- Lists
- Putting Them Together

# String Manipulation (Interpolation)

## Idea
Suppose that during your python program you wanted to insert a string in the middle of another string

"One day <span style="text-decoration:underline">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> went to the store"

```
```
    One day Mark went to the store
```
you can also use multiple arguments
```python
print "{} is {}'s favorite day to {}".format("Saturday", "John", "sleep")
```
```
    Saturday is John's favorite day to sleep
```

```
```
    The rain in spain falls mostly in the plains
```

---

# String Manipulation (aside)

## Methods
What's with the weird `"string".format` notation?

Whenver you see `variable.something` python in invoking the "method" called "something" on "variable"

A method is just a function that's bound to an object. We'll talk about objects more later but for now I'll just say that a string is a type of object

# String Manipulation (Concatenation)

## Idea
Suppose that during your python program you wanted to combine two strings

## How's it done
```python
print "That was " + "easy"
```
```
    That was easy 
```

This is known as "string concatenation" or just "concatention" in programmer parlance 

---

# String Manipulation (Length)

## Idea
What about finding the length of a string?

## How's it done
```python
print len("How many letters do I have")
```
```
    26    
```

---

## Idea
What about finding the length of a string?

## How's it done
```python
print len("How many letters do I have")
```
```
    26    
```

Why is `len` not a method?

## Idea

## How's it done
```python
print len("How many letters do I have")
```
```
    26    
```

Why is `len` not a method?

In short because it's used for other things (that aren't strings). We'll get to that later

---

# String Manipulation (Others)

There are a **lot** of other cool string methods

```python
str.capitalize()
str.center(width[, fillchar])
str.count(sub[, start[, end]])
str.decode([encoding[, errors]])
str.encode([encoding[, errors]])
str.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]])
str.expandtabs([tabsize])Â¶
str.find(sub[, start[, end]])
str.index(sub[, start[, end]])
str.isalnum()
str.isalpha()
str.isdigit()
str.islower()
str.isspace()
str.istitle() (seriously?)
str.isupper()
str.replace(old, new[, count])
...
```

but I'm not going to go into detail on all of them

---

# Lists (Syntax)

## Idea
A list is just an ordered collection of things

---

# Lists (Syntax)

## Idea
A list is just an ordered collection of things.

## How's it done
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'An entire cow', 'A meat cleaver'] 
```

---

# Lists (Access)

## Idea
In order to access a specific "element" of a list you use the `[index]` notation

---

# Lists (Access)

## Idea
In order to access a specific "element" of a list you use the `[index]` notation

## How's it done
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
print groceries[0]
```
```
    Eggs
```

Here we would say that "Eggs" is element at index `0`

---

## How's it done
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
print groceries[0]
```
```
    Eggs
```

Here we would say that "Eggs" is element at index `0`

### Why do the indices start at `0`?

### Why do the indicies start at `0`?

C/C++ do it this way

Relationship to memory alignment

Dijkstra and half open intervals

etc.

# Lists (Access)

## Idea
In order to access a specific "element" of a list you use the `[index]` notation

## How's it done (cont.)
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
print "Don't forget to buy {} and {}".format(groceries[0], groceries[2])
```
```
    Don't forget to buy Eggs and An entire cow
```

# List Access (Slicing)

## Idea

What if you only need a certain subsection of list?

---

# List Access (Slicing)

## Idea

What if you only need a certain subsection of list?

## How's it done

The notation is basically `[start:end]`
```python
words = ["My", "name", "is", "Judge"]
print words[0:2]
```
```
    ['My', 'name'] 
```

print words[0:2]
```
```
    ['My', 'name'] 
```
`start` or `end` can be omitted and the selection will continue to the beginning or the end of the array (respectively)
```python
words = ["My", "name", "is", "Judge"]
print words[1:]
```
```
    ['name', 'is', 'Judge'] 
```

---

# List Manipulation (Insertion)

## Idea 

What if you need to add something to a list


## How's it done

You can add an item to the end of a list using `append`
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
groceries.append("seasoning")
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'An entire cow', 'A meat cleaver', 'seasoning']

```
You can add an item to an arbitrary position by using `insert`
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
groceries.insert(2, "A bigger car")
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'A bigger car', 'An entire cow', 'A meat cleaver'] 
```

# List Manipulation (Removal)

## Idea

What if you need to remove something from a list

---

# List Manipulation (Removal)

## Idea

What if you need to remove something from a list

## How's it done

To remove the element at the back of a list you can use `pop`

```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
groceries.pop()
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'An entire cow']
```

---

# List Manipulation (Removal)

## Idea

## How's it done

To remove the element at the back of a list you can use `pop`

```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
groceries.pop()
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'An entire cow']
```

`pop` actually returns the element that was just removed which you can save for later like so
```python
groceries = ["Eggs", "Oatmeal", "An entire cow", "A meat cleaver"]
last_item = groceries.pop()
print "On second thought let's not get {}".format(last_item)
```
```
    On second thought let's not get A meat cleaver 
```

groceries.remove("An entire cow")
print groceries
```
```
    ['Eggs', 'Oatmeal', 'A meat cleaver']

## How's it done
```python
characters = ["Fred", "Steve", "Sally", "Bob", "Willma", "Tracey", "Waldo", "Dino"]
where_is_waldo = characters.index("Waldo")
print "Waldo is at index {}".format(where_is_waldo)

## How's it done
```python
characters = ["Fred", "Steve", "Sally", "Bob", "Willma", "Tracey", "Waldo", "Dino"]
where_is_waldo = characters.index("Waldo")
print "Waldo is at index {}".format(where_is_waldo)
```
```
    Waldo is at index 6
```
You have to be careful to not look for things that aren't there though
```python
characters = ["Fred", "Steve", "Sally", "Bob", "Willma", "Tracey", "Waldo", "Dino"]
characters.index("that guy")
```
```
    Traceback (most recent call last):

# List Operations (Other)

There are only a few other list methods that we won't touch on (but hopefully they're pretty obvious)
```
list.sort() (sorts a list alphabetically)
list.reverse() (reverses a list)
list.count(x) (counts the number of times x appears in the list)
```
