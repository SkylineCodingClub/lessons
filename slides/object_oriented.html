# Objected Oriented Programming
## Making the abstract more concrete
---

# Problem

You want to create an image editing program that offers tools much like the one an artist has in real life.

--

This program will have tools

--

.tool[![Paintbrush](http://www.harborfreight.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_18039.jpg)]

--
...

--

How do you design and manage the abstractions in this image editing program in a way that will allow you to  

--
- Reason about the correctness of your program?

--
- Add new tools?
---

# Observations

--

All of the tools will *do* the same thing

--

You can "use" them on your image (a set of pixels) and they will alter that image and return a new set of pixels 

--

You will probably start using them in the same way (holding down the mouse button for example)

---

# Object Orientation

--

Our tool example is a perfect candidate for object origntation.

--

This is because we have an unkown number of things that have to perform a set number of functions

--

In this case we have *tools* that need to be *used*

---

# Aside: What is an "object" in programming?

--

**Def**: In the object-oriented programming paradigm, "object" refers to a particular instance of a class where the object can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures.
--

## Functions

--
```cplusplus
class Cat {
    void meow() {
        std::cout << "meow";
    }
}
```
```python
class Cat:
    def meow(self):
        print "meow"
```
---
# What is an "object" in programming? (cont.)
## Variables
--

```cplusplus
class Cat {
    Cat(int catAge) {
        this->age = catAge;
    }
    void meow() {
        std::cout << "meow";
    }
    int age;
}
```
```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age
    def meow(self):
        print "meow"
```
---
# What is an "object" in programming? (cont.)
## Data Structures
--

```cplusplus
class Cat {
    Cat(int catAge, Address catLocation) {
        this->age = catAge;
        this->location = catLocation;
    }
    void meow() {
        std::cout << "meow";
    }
    int age;
    Address location;
}
```
```python
class Cat:
    def __init__(self, age, location):
        self.age = age
        self.location = location
    def meow(self):
        print "meow"
```
---
# What is an "object" in programming? (cont.)

## Example
--

```cplusplus
#include <cat.h>
#include <address.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv[]) {
    Address home(1234, "Nowhere Street", "Ann Arbor", "MI", 48105);
    Cat fluffy(7, home);
    fluffy.meow();

    return 0;
}
```
--

Where does fluffy live?

--

How old is fluffy?

--

As you can see objects can make it easier to understand the programs that we write

---
## Object Orientation

So how can we orient our program around such abstractions?

--

The real power in using objects is being able to have objects which conform to a specific interface

--

What if all you know is that an object is a ball?

--

Can you still list things you can do with that ball?

--

What if it's a billiard ball? Are there things specific to a billiard ball?

---
## Object Orientation

A `billiard ball` is a *type of* `ball` and as such it conforms to certain normal `ball` uses

--

Here is an example of a `BilliardBall` class that builds off of a `Ball` class.

--
```python
class BilliardBall(Ball):
    def __init__(self, number):
        self.number = number 
```

--

Why is this useful?

--

As we talked about before all balls have *some* base set of properties. Those properties can be put in the "base class" or `Ball` class in this example.

---

## Object Orientation
--

##Example
--

```python
class Ball:
    def __init__(self):
        self.accel = Vector(0,0)

    def applyForce(self, force):
        self.accel.x += force.x / self.mass; 
        self.accel.y += force.y / self.mass; 

    def updatePosition(self):
        self.velocity.x += self.accel.x;
        self.position.x += self.velocity.x;
        self.velocity.y += self.accel.y;
        self.position.y += self.velocity.y;
```
--

Now any type of ball can have a force applied to it just by *inheriting* from the *base class*

---

## Object Orientation

Lets see how this works in our image editing example

--

```python
class Tool:
    def use(image, x, y):
        print "This is only a base class I do nothing"
```

---

## Object Orientation

### Paint Brush

```python
class PaintBrush(Tool):
    def __init__(self, color, width):
        self.color = color
        self.width = width

    def use(self, image, x, y):
        for row in range(y - self.width, y):
            if(row < 0):
                next
            for col in range(x - self.width, x):
                if(col < 0):
                    next
                image[row][col] = self.color
```
---

## Object Orientation

### Paint Bucket

```python
class PaintBucket(Tool):
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color;

    def use(self, image, x, y):
        for row in range(len(image)):
            for col in range(len(image[row])):
                image[row][col] = self.color 
```

---

## Tying it together

--

You can imagine we have a `Pallet` class somewhere with the current state of the user interface

--

```python
class Pallet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.selectedTool = None
        self.toolHistory = []
        self.image = None

    def selectTool(tool):
        self.selectedTool = tool
        self.toolHistory.push(tool)

    def useTool(x, y):
        self.selectedTool.use(self.image, x, y)

    def usePreviousTool(tool):
        self.selectTool(toolHistory.pop());

    def selectImage(self, image):
        self.image = image
```
---

## Tying it together

Now we have the ability to use lots of different tools without knowing or caring about what *exactly* they do.

--

```python
# ... somewhere above here we load the image and call it "image"
whiteBrush = PaintBrush(Color(0, 0, 0), 2)
blueBucket = PaintBucket(Color(0, 0, 255))
pallet = Pallet()
pallet.selectImage(image)
pallet.selectTool(blueBucket)
pallet.useTool(0, 0)
pallet.selectTool(whiteBrush)
pallet.useTool(5, 5)
```

--

You can see that this should fill an image completely with blue pixels and then draw a 2x2 white square at coordinate (5,5)

---
