# Problem (Todo list)

You've created a todo-list program which gives the user a way to view and
modify a todo list.

# Chess Example (model study)
This is a view of a game of chess:
```python
    board = [['r', 'n', 'b', 'q', 'k', 'b', 'n', 'r'],
             ['p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p'],
             ['',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  ''],
             ['',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  ''],
             ['',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  ''],
             ['',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  '',  ''],
             ['P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P', 'P'],
             ['R', 'N', 'B', 'Q', 'K', 'B', 'N', 'R']]

This is also a game of chess (this one is pretty):

Ready-only because we only want to keep track of 1 model
