# Software Principals I
## Don't Repeat Yourself

# Problem

You need to create a program that does the same thing in multiple places

--

There are two main solutions to this

--

- Copy the code
- Encapsulate the code 

--

Example:
```python
class person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def say_name(self):
        print "Hi I'm {0}".format(self.name.title())

    def greet(self, target):
        print "Hey {0}, it's nice to mee you I'm {1}".format(
            target.name.title(), self.name.title())
```
--

What's wrong with this?

--

Notice all the calls to ".title()" every time we need a peron's name?

---

## What's the big deal?

--

We made a couple of redundant calls. In the grand scheme of things it's just a
little extra typing...

--

Repeating code in this way presents issues with

--

- Flexibility

--

- Testability

---

## What's the big deal? (Flexibility)

--

You've just decided to give the option for each "person" object to have
a title (like Mr., Mrs. or Dr.)...

--

Now you have to find everywhere in your code that references `self.name`
and make sure that you prefix it with a title

--

`self.name` becomes `"{0} {1}".format(self.title, self.name)` and that's if
you don't want to make sure it's properly title cased!

--

```python
class person:
    def __init__(self, name, title=""):
        self.name = name
        self.title = title
    
    def say_name(self):
        print "Hi I'm {0}".format(self.name.title + self.name.title())

    def greet(self, target):
        print "Hey {0}, it's nice to mee you I'm {1}".format(
            target.name.title + target.name.title(), 
            self.name.title + self.name.title())
```

--

This quickly becomes a pain if you need to change things about `self.name`

???

The more unsure you are about how things will evolve the more abstract you
should make a concept. If it's "pretty certain" don't waste your time. 
Abstraction isn't done for its own sake except in math.

---

## What's the big deal? (Testability)

--

When working with a test-drive-design we want to verify our code conforms to
a certain set of behaviors

???

I haven't talked too much about test driven design but it suffices to say that
it is centered around writing tests to verify that your code behaves the way that
you expect it to

???

--

But now the behavior is duplicated

???

The code to add the title to the front of the name is 2 seperate

???

--

So there will need to be two similar tests checking for the same behavior

---

The important thing to nice here is the duplication of checks for the addition
of the "Mr" prefix and the correct capitalization behavior

```python
test_out = StringIO()
sys.stdout = test_out

def test_person_say_name():
    test_person = person("tom")

    test_person.say_name()
    output = test_out.getvalue().strip()

    # check for default no title and proper casing
    assert output == "Hi I'm Tom"

    test_person.title = "Mr."
    test_person.say_name()
    output = test_out.getvalue().strip()

    # check for adding title to output
    assert output == "Hi I'm Mr. Tom"

def test_person_greet():
    test_person = person("tom")
    test_person2 = person("steve")

    # check for default no title and proper casing
    test_person.greet(test_person2)

    output = test_out.getvalue().strip()

    assert output == "Hey Steve it's nice to meet you I'm Tom"

    # check for adding title to output
    test_person.title = "Mr"

    test_person.greet()
    output = test_out.getvalue().strip()

    test_person.title = "Mr."
    assert output == "Hey Steve it's nice to meet you I'm Mr. Tom"
```

---

## What's the big deal? (Testability)

--

With many tests this will quickly get out of hand

--

Oh no! We forgot about making sure `person.title` is always capitalized.
Better go change that... everywhere

--

Hopefully I've convinced you that duplicaiton of code, when it can be avoided,
often should be

---

## What's the solution? (Flexibility)

(D)on't (R)epeat (Y)ourself

???

The hany acronym "dry" is highlighted here for you

???

--

The solution here is very simple because it's a simple example

--

```python
class person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def get_name(self):
        return "{0} {1}".format(self.title.title(), self.name.title())
    
    def say_name(self):
        print "Hi I'm {0}".format(self.get_name())

    def greet(self, target):
        print "Hey {0}, it's nice to mee you I'm {1}".format(
            target.get_name(), self.get_name())
```

--

See how I snuck in that little mistake we realized above?

--

I added proper captilization of `person.title` and it was an 8 character fix!

---

## What's the solution? (Testability)

We now write one set of tests to make sure get name is functioning properly and
that's all!

--

```python
def test_person_get_name():
    test_person = person("tom")

    # check for proper captilization
    assert test_person.get_name() == "Hi I'm Tom"

    # check for proper title
    test_person.title = "mr."
    assert test_person.get_name() == "Hi I'm Mr. Tom"
```

---

## Caveats

--

DRY can drive you crazy

--

You won't get rid of all the repetition forever

--

If you designed your system poorly you may have no choice but to repeat
yourself

--

Don't do a full overhaul if you paint yourlself into a corner
just learn from your mistakes

???

Right now when you're learning how to properly abstract code and refactor
things lean on the side of doing it. It's good practice if nothing else.

???

--

Remember the program that runs is always better than the perfectly designed one
that was never finished
